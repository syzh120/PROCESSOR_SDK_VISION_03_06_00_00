<h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>
The Network Developer's Kit (NDK) is a platform for development
and demonstration of network enabled applications on TI embedded
processors,
currently limited to the TMS320C6000 family and ARM processors.
The code included in this NDK release is generic C code which runs
on any C64P, C66, C674, ARM9, Cortex-A8, Cortex-A9, Cortex-A15, Cortex-M3,
or Cortex-M4 device.
Users can obtain an appropriate NDK Support Package (NSP) for the various
supported
platforms separately. The NDK Support Packages include demonstration
software
showcasing capabilities across a range of network enabled
applications. In addition, the stack serves as a rapid prototype
platform
for the development of network and packet processing applications, or
to add
network connectivity to existing applications for communications,
configuration, and control. Using the components provided in the NDK,
developers can quickly move from development concepts to working
implementations attached to the network. Please check the
<a href="http://software-dl.ti.com/dsps/dsps_public_sw/sdo_sb/targetcontent/ndk/index.html">
release website</a>
for previous release notes and NDK Support Packages.

<h2><a name="Upgrade_Info">Upgrade Information</a></h2>

<p>
All the libraries in this release support either IPv4 or IPv6 (or both)
and NIMU. The low-level (LL) packet driver architecture has been
deprecated since NDK v2.0.0 release.
</p>


<p>The NDK stack in this release supports SYS/BIOS&nbsp;6.37.02.27 (or
greater) and is meant to be used with CCSv5.4 and up. The OS Abstraction Layer
(OSAL) and HAL libraries
have been provided for SYS/BIOS 6.x only. &nbsp;DSP/BIOS 5.x support
can be found in previous versions of the NDK.
</p>


<p>
Network Support Packages (NSPs), which contain Ethernet drivers,  are released
independently of this product and are usually shipped as part of a sofware
development kit (SDK).  The NSPs for evmOMAPL138 and evm6748 platforms can be
obtained from the 
<a href="http://software-dl.ti.com/dsps/dsps_public_sw/sdo_sb/targetcontent/ndk/index.html">NDK website</a>.
Ethernet drivers for MCU devices can be found in the TI-RTOS product (see the 
<a href="http://software-dl.ti.com/dsps/dsps_public_sw/sdo_sb/targetcontent/tirtos/index.html">TI-RTOS download website</a>).
  For other devices, please contact your FAE for where to obtain the appropriate
SDK.
</p>

<h3>Removal of sa_len, sin_len and sin6_len socket address struct members</h3>
<p>Starting in NDK 2.24, the socket address structures have been redefined to remove the following fields:</p>
<code>
  <ul>
    <li>sa_len</li>
    <li>sin_len</li>
    <li>sin6_len</li>
  </ul>
</code>
<p> Applications which contain references to these fields must be updated due to this change!
</p>
<p>This was done in order to make the NDK conform to industry standards, which recommend that these length fields not be implemented, nor used.  Removal of these length fields also increases compatiblity between network stacks interoperating with the NDK.</p>
<p>The NDK's socket address structures are now defined as follows:
<pre>
<code>
struct sockaddr {
    UINT8    sa_family;         /* address family */
    char     sa_data[14];       /* socket data */
};

struct sockaddr_in {
    UINT8   sin_family;         /* address family */
    UINT16  sin_port;           /* port */
    struct  in_addr sin_addr;
    INT8    sin_zero[8];        /* fixed length address value */
};

struct sockaddr_in6 {
    UINT8   sin6_family;            /* address family */
    UINT16  sin6_port;              /* port */
    UINT32  sin6_flowinfo;          /* IPv6 flow information */
    struct  in6_addr sin6_addr;     /* IPv6 address */
    UINT32  sin6_scope_id;          /* scope id */
};
</code>

<hr>
<h2><a name="Known_Issues">Known Issues</a></h2>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">GNU Applications Must Define _POSIX_SOURCE:</span>
<br><br>
Both the NDK and GNU define the fd_set structure.  Since SYS/BIOS ships GNU
header files, this conflict may arise when building NDK applications using GCC.

In order to avoid such conflicts, GCC apps need to throw -D_POSIX_SOURCE in
the application's compiler options in order to take the NDK's definition of
fd_set.
<br><br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Terminated Tasks Must Be Automatically Deleted:</span>
<br><br>
The NDK has been updated to take advantage of the new SYS/BIOS feature
which automatically deletes dynamically created Task objects which have
reached the terminated state. &nbsp;If your application configuration
is loading the package 'ti.ndk.config' and/or using the
'ti.ndk.config.Global.xdc' module, then Task clean up will be set up
correctly for you.<br><br>However, if your application configuration is
not loading the 'ti.ndk.config' package or the
'ti.ndk.config.Global.xdc' module, then you must add the following
lines of code to your application configuration (*.cfg) file:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">var Task = xdc.useModule('ti.sysbios.knl.Task');<br>Task.deleteTerminatedTasks = true;<br></div><br>If not, you may experience out of memory issues due to improper Task clean up. &nbsp;Please refer to section&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">5.2.2 TaskCreate(), TaskExit(), and TaskDestroy()</span> of the <a href="docs/spru523i.pdf">NDK User's
    Guide</a> for more information.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Known Bugs</span>:<ul>
<li>SDOCM00098788 - ARM9 IPv6 telnet console echo application shows negative number for send rate</li>
<li>SDOCM00090817 - IPv6 init command fails sporadically</li>
<li>SDOCM00075040 - running ping command within a telnet session on the ndk causes the terminal and telnet session to hang</li>

  <li>SDSCM00025064 - DSP crash on Reboot with a PPPoE server on NDK.
      Workaround: Ensure that the PPPoE server of the NDK stack is closed
      before rebooting the stack.
  </li>

  <li>SDSCM00024506 - PPPoE client connection handle is not removed after
  PPPoE session timeout. Workaround: Ensure that the session timeout on the
  PPPoE server is configured to be a large value to avoid this issue.
  </li>
  
</ul>

<h2><a name="Benchmarks">Benchmarks</a></h2>


<p>NDK throughput benchmarks (described here: <a href="http://www.ti.com/lit/an/spraaq5a/spraaq5a.pdf">Network Developer's Kit (NDK) Benchmark and Sizing</a>)
were re-built and run using the TCI6482/DSK6455 platform in order to
obtain throughput and CPU load information against NDK 2.22 libraries
(for NIMU architecture only).
</p>
<p>The benchmarks were run using with both IPv6 enabled and disabled (for pure
IPv4).  Some minor differences between CPU load between these two scenarios is
attributed to cache thrashing due to the extra IPv6 code.</p><p>Sizing
benchmarks were obtained from applications that,&nbsp;although basic,
demonstrate "real world" usage of the TCP/IP stack. &nbsp;The following
summarizes the size benchmark applications:</p>
<ul>

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">basic</span> - The base application; a
  bare minimum, ping-able NDK application.&nbsp; Contains no sockets, uses
  DHCP to obtain IP address.</li>

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">tcpSocket</span>
  - &nbsp;Minimized configuration for the TI-RTOS tcpEcho example that
  contains a single TCP socket running in a single task.&nbsp; The TCP
  send/receive buffers have been lowered to a value of 512 bytes. Uses
  DHCP to obtain IP address.</li>

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">tcpEchoServer</span>
  - Minimal configuration for application that creates a TCP echo daemon
  for the NDK library function "dtask_tcp_echo" (from
  ti/ndk/tools/servers).&nbsp; The program echoes data received back to
  its sender.&nbsp; Uses DHCP to obtain IP address.</li>

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">udpSocket</span>
  - &nbsp;Minimized configuration of the TI-RTOS udpEcho example that
  contains a single UDP socket running in a single task.&nbsp; The UDP
  receive buffer has been lowered to a value of 512 bytes. Uses
  DHCP to obtain IP address.</li>

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">udpEchoServer</span>
  - Minimal configuration for application that creates a UDP echo daemon
  for the NDK library function "dtask_udp_echo" (from
  ti/ndk/tools/servers).&nbsp; The program echoes data received back to
  its sender.&nbsp; Uses DHCP to obtain IP address.</li>

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">httpServer</span> - &nbsp;Minimal
  configuration for an HTTP server with a very basic web page and CGI
  script. Uses DHCP to obtain IP address.<br><br></li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="Examples">Examples</a></h2>


<p>NDK examples are no longer included as part of the NDK core release.  All
   examples are now located in a seperate Network Support Package (NSP).
</p>
<p>
   This NDK release was validated using the latest NSP 1.10.02.09 product for the
   evmOMAPL138 and evm6748 and so works best with the examples found in that
   product. Users who have the evmOMAPL138 or evm6748 hardware platforms should
   make sure to use the latest NSP product with this NDK release.
</p>
<p>
   The latest NSP product may be downloaded from the
   <a href="http://software-dl.ti.com/dsps/dsps_public_sw/sdo_sb/targetcontent/ndk/index.html">NDK website</a>
