.SH DESCRIPTION
The C/C++ ANSI Parser.
.SH OPTIONS
The following options are accepted by this tool:
.SS Processor Options:
.SS
.TP
-v=id
Specify silicon core version. When not specified by the user, the compiler defaults to 200
.SS Optimization Options:
.SS
.TP
-mf[=0-5]
Control speed vs. size trade-offs in optimization. A value of 5 indicates fully optimizing for speed with a potentially large code size penalty while a value of 0 indicates fully optimizing for size.  Values between 0 and 5 indicate trade-offs between the two extremes.  If this option is not specified, or if the option is specified with no argument, a default value of 4 is used. The argument to the option is optional, and if not specified it will default to: 4
.TP
-O[=off,0,1,2,3]
Set compiler optimization level.

Level 0 includes register optimizations.  Level 1 adds local optimizations. Level 2 further adds global optimizations. Level 3 further adds interprocedure optimizations. The argument to the option is optional, and if not specified it will default to: 2
.SS Debug Options:
.SS
.TP
-g
Enable full symbolic DWARF debugging in the generated object or out file. [Same as -gw]
.TP
-gw
Enable full symbolic DWARF debugging in the generated object or out file. [Same as -g]
.TP
-mn[=on,off]
Optimize fully in the presence of debug directives The argument to the option is optional, and if not specified it will default to: on
.TP
--symdebug:none
Disable debug and suppress all symbolic debug information from being included in the generated object or out file.
.TP
--symdebug:skeletal
Enable symbolic debug information for program analysis. (default)
.SS Include Options:
.SS
.TP
-I=dir
Add the specified dir(ectory) to the #include file search path list.
.TP
-kh
Tool will output a header file detailing each function provided. Includes parameter register count, initialization, loop, and basic run functions
.TP
--preinclude=filename
Include the source code of the indicated file at the beginning of the compilation. This can be used to establish standard macro definitions, etc. The file name is searched for in the directories on the include search list. The files are processed in the order in which they were specified.
.SS Control Options:
.SS
.TP
-c
Disable linking, overriding -z (if used).
.TP
-h
Show usage information.  When followed by another option or a phrase display that option's detailed information, or search for options related to that phrase.
.TP
-n
Compile only; do not assemble
.TP
-z[=arguments]
After compiling all the source files, perform a link and pass all the options following this option to the linker.
.SS Advanced Debug Options:
.SS
.TP
--symdebug:keep_all_types
Keep referenced type info (default for elf w/ debug)
.SS Language Options:
.SS
.TP
--create_pch=filename
Create a precompiled header file with the name specified. This option specifies the filename for the precompiled header file. If this option is not used, the precompiled header file will use the primary source file name as its filename with .pch as suffix.
.TP
--exceptions
Enable C++ exception handling
.TP
-fg
Treat C files as C++ files
.TP
--float_operations_allowed=all,32,64,none
Control the acceptable precision of floating point operations. The default is all.
.TP
--gcc
This option enables the support for GCC extensions.  This feature is incompatible with strict ANSI mode.
.TP
--keep_unneeded_statics
The parser, by default, will remark about and then remove any unreferenced static variables.  This option will keep the parser from deleting unreferenced static variables and any static functions that are, in turn referenced by these variables.
.TP
-pc
Enable parser support for multibyte character sequences in comments, string literals, and character constants.
.TP
--pch
Automatically create and/or use precompiled header files. This option will enable EDG parser to provide a mechanism for, in effect, taking a snapshot of the state of the compilation at a particular point and writing it to a disk file before completing the parsing; then, when recompiling the same source file or compiling another file with the same set of header files, it can recognize the `snapshot point`, and reload this file instead of recompile these headers. In this way, compilation time can be reduced.
.TP
--pch_dir=dir
Specify path where precompiled header file will reside. This option will direct the parser to put the generated precompiled header file in the specified directory. If this option is not used, the precompiled header file will be put into the same directory as the primary source file
.TP
--pch_verbose
This option displays a message for each precompiled header file that is considered but can not be used. It also gives the reason why it can not be used.
.TP
-pe
Enable support for embedded C++
.TP
-pi
Ignore the inline keyword while parsing.
.TP
-pk
Enable K & R C compatibility.
.TP
-pl

.TP
-pm
Enable program mode compilation.
.TP
-pn
Disable intrinsic functions in the parser.
.TP

.TP
-px
Output xref listing to .crl file
.TP

.TP
--static_template_instantiation

.SS Parser Preprocessing Options:
.SS
.TP

Also see the -ppa option to continue compilation after generating the dependency list (similar to gcc).
.TP
-ppi[=filename]
Generate an include list for the source file into the file <filename>.pp and then exit.  Optionally, name the output file.  The output will include only those files directly included by the source file.   Also see the -ppa option to continue compilation after generating the include list (similar to gcc).
.TP

Only preprocess the source file(s) and then stop; maintain #line directives in the output..
.TP
-ppm[=filename]
Generate a list of predefined and user defined macros for the source file into the file <filename>.pp and then exit.  Optionally, name the output file. The output will include only those files directly included by the source file.   Also see the -ppa option to continue compilation after generating the macro list (similar to gcc).
.TP
-ppo
Only preprocess the source file(s) and then stop.
.SS Predefined Symbols Options:
.SS

-ol2
File does not define any RTS library func (def.)
.TP
--printf_support=nofloat,minimal,full
Printf/sprintf functions use a common low level routine, _printfi which processes a given printf format string.  The full version of _printfi provides formatting capabilities that are not required in typical embedded applications. To address this the C runtime library also includes two limited of versions of _printfi that provide a useful subset of the formatting features specified by C library standard.

One version excludes support for printing floating values. All format specifiers except for %f, %g, %G, %e, or %E are supported. To specify this version use the option '--printf_support=nofloat' when linking.

The other version only supports printing of integer, char, or string values without width or precision flags.  Only %%, %d, %o, %c, %s and %x are supported.  To specify this version use the option '--printf_support=minimal' when linking.
