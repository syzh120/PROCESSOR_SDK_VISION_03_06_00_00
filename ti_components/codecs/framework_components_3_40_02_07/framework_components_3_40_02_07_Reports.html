<h2 align="center">June 2016</h2>

<h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>
This report summarizes results from two software quality assessment
tools used to analyze the software in this product:
<ul>
  <li>Static Program Analysis:
    <a href="http://coverity.com/products/static-analysis.html">
      Coverity Static Analysis</a>
  </li>
  <li>MISRA-C:2004 Rules:
    <a href="http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/TI_Compiler_Information">
      Texas Instruments C/C++ Compiler</a>
  </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Unless noted below, all source code, both .c and .h files, for
embedded target libraries was analyzed using these tools.
</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="CovSummary">Static Program Analysis Summary</a></h2>
<p>
This report summarizes the Static Program Analysis results. For each
library, a listing provides:
<ul>
  <li>the command-line invocation for the tool actually used for the
  analysis</li>
  <li>summary of lines-of-code (LoC) analyzed and defect types and
  counts (if any)</li>
  <li>location of defects in the source code (file name and line
  number) (if any)</li>
</ul>

</p>
<p>Justification for Not Addressing Coverity Violations</p>
<ul>
<li>In the ti.sdo.fc.edma3 package, a coverity violation of "OVERRUN_STATIC" is being reported but this seems like a false positive.
The complaint is regarding the value "1010u" being assigned to resObj.resId and being used to reference an array.
In reality, this value is overwritten by an actual EDMA3 resource Id by the EDMA3_RM_alloc APIs.</li>
<hr>

<h2><a name="MisraSummary">MISRA-C:2004 Summary</a></h2>
<p>
There are several rules in MISRA-C:2004 that are contrary to
long-standing coding standards used in this product, and, hence will
not be addressed in the product source code. These rules are listed in the
table below. The corresponding checks were explicitly disabled in the
tool when the source code was analyzed.

<p>Justification for Not Addressing MISRA-C:2004 Violations</p>
<ul>
<li>In one case, 19.10/R is being reported that complains about
macro arguments not being enclosed in parantheses. The macros in
this particular instance have arguments that represent elements of
a C structure. Enclosing these in parantheses cause C compilation
errors and hence this error has been ignored. We are investigating if
this requires a cgtools fix.
