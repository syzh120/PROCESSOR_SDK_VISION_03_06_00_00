<h1>Build Instructions for Framework Components Examples</h1>
<hr>
<h2>General Information</h2>
<p>This page explains how to build the examples provided in the
Framework Components product.
</p>

<hr>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>See the <a href="../framework_components_3_40_02_07_ReleaseNotes.html">Release Notes</a>
for the specific software and hardware components this release of
Framework Components has been validated against.
</p>
<hr>
<h2>Directory Structure</h2>
<p>Examples are provided in zip file format under the directory
<ul><tt>&lt;FC_INSTALL_DIR&gt;/examples/archive</tt>, </ul> where
<tt>&lt;FC_INSTALL_DIR&gt;</tt> is the root directory of your Codec Engine
insatallation. Under the <tt>archive</tt> directory, you will find
directories named for platforms containing zipped examples specific to
the given platform.  Each example is self-contained, so that it can be
unzipped and built in a directory of your choice.  It is also possible
to build all the examples for your platform from the makefile located in
<tt>&lt;FC_INSTALL_DIR&gt;/examples</tt>.
</p>
Directories containing examples:
// ls -R examples | grep ':$' | grep -v '/lib' | grep -v '/package' | sed -e 's/:$//' -e 's/[^-][^\/]*\//--/g' -e 's/^/   /' -e 's/-/|/'
<pre>

<h2>Building the examples: step-by-step instructions</h2>
Here we will describe the steps to build all the examples for your
platform, from the root of the <tt>examples</tt> directory.
<h3>1. [Optional] Copy the entire "examples" tree out of the product</h3>
<p>
This step is optional, but recommended if you plan to modify the
examples in any way. It will ensure you have a backup copy of the
original examples, as provided by the Framework Components product.
</p>
<p><i>Important</i>: throughout the rest of this document, we will use the
following notation:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><tt>&lt;FC_EXAMPLES_INSTALL_DIR&gt;</tt> - absolute path of the
  examples directory or the copy you made,
  e.g. <tt>/usr/work/examples</tt></li>
  <li><tt>&lt;FC_INSTALL_DIR&gt;</tt> - root directory of your Codec Engine
  installation. The original examples are in
  <tt>&lt;FC_INSTALL_DIR&gt;/examples</tt>.</li>
  <li><tt>&lt;BIOS_INSTALL_DIR&gt;</tt> - root directory of your DSP/BIOS
  installation.</li>
  <li><tt>&lt;XDC_INSTALL_DIR&gt;</tt> - root directory of your xdctools
  installation.</li>
  <li><i>directory/file</i> - position of the file relative to the
  examples directory; for examples, <tt>ti/sdo/fc/examples/codecs/makefile</tt> refers to
  <tt>&lt;CE_EXAMPLES_INSTALL_DIR&gt;/ti/sdo/fc/examples/codecs/makefile</tt>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Manage xdcpaths.mak and products.mak</h3>
<p>
At the root of the examples directory you will find the file,
<b>xdcpaths.mak</b>, which must be edited for your particular usecase.
Edit the following variables in <b>xdcpaths.mak</b>, as described below.
</p>
<h3>2.1 FC_INSTALL_DIR</h3>
<p>
The <tt>FC_INSTALL_DIR</tt> variable indicates where the Framework Components 
product is installed.
<p>

<h3>2.2 DEVICE</h3>
<p>
The <tt>DEVICE</tt> variable indicates which hardware platforms should be
built for.  Set this variable to one of the supported platforms listed in
the <b>xdcpaths.mak</b> file.
</p>

<h3>3. Dependencies</h3>
<p>Dependencies can be set in $(FC_INSTALL_DIR)/products.mak, which is then
included by <b>examples/xdcpaths.mak</b>. Dependencies can also be set in individual example directories' products.mak, but they will be overriden with by the
top-level products.mak.</p>
<h3>INSTALL_DIR</h3>
<ul>
  <li> The many <b>INSTALL_DIR</b> variables let you set the path to other
  dependent components. Depending on the programs you are building and the
  devices you build for, you will need to set the path for one or more of
  these components.  If your distribution includes cetools/, you can set
  many of these variables to $(FC_INSTALL_DIR)/cetools.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Codegen Tools</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Correct code generation tool paths will need to be specified for the
  architectures you will be building for. For instance, to build for the C6472
  device, you will need to set the appropriate cgtools variables to the TI C64x
  toolchain location.<br />
  Note that for TI toolchains, this is the directory that contains bin/,
  include/, and lib/ subdirectories.<br />
  </li>
</ul>


<p>
The makefile in the top-level example directory unzips the examples for
the device specified in the xdcpaths.mak file, into the examples directory,
and then builds them.

Each example contains a GNU <tt>makefile</tt> and a <tt>products.mak</tt>,
which enable you to build it in the directory where it is unzipped. The
<tt>products.mak</tt> for the individual example will look for a
products.mak file one, two, or three directories above, to allow for a
common products.mak file that can be used for the examples.

<p>Please keep in mind that <b><span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">MOST
BUILD TROUBLES OCCUR WHEN ONE OF THE VARIOUS <tt>*_INSTALL_DIR</tt>
VARIABLES ARE INCORRECT!</span></b>
Make sure there are no extra spaces (check the end of lines!), that every
individual path (segment separated by the semicolon) is correct, character
for character, and the build process is very likely to go smoothly.
</p>


<h3>4. Build examples</h3>
<p>After updating the variables described above, from your examples/ directory, type:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>gmake clean<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gmake</b></p>

<p>All examples appropriate for your specified environment and device will be
built.  This will include codecs and apps. Or in your specific example directory (for e.g., ex01_universal_dma_copy), 
type</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>gmake clean<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gmake</b></p>
This will build all the libs/executables that are specified in the <b>makefile</b> 

<hr>
<h2>Running the example applications</h2>

<p>All of these examples are single core examples that can be run by loading the executable on the corresponding core in CCS and letting it run till the end. In most cases logging/trace is enabled and that will generate useful output on the Console.
