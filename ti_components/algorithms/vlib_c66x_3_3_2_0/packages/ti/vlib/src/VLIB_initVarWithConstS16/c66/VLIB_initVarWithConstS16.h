/**
* @par Description:
*  The function VLIB_initVarWithConstS16() is used to initialize a running variance
*  buffer with a constant variance initial estimate.  In this process, it is assumed
*  that the initial value "constVar" is in SQ0.15 format.
*
* @par
*    @param [out] runningVar       Exponentially weighted running variance (SQ12.3)
*    @param [in]  constVar         Initial variance (SQ12.3)
*    @param [in]  pixelCount       Number of pixels to process (UQ32.0)
*
* @par Assumptions:
*    - I/O buffers are assumed to be double-word aligned and not aliased.
*    - The pixelCount must be a multiple of 8.
*
* @par Implementation Notes:
*    - This code is fully interruptible
*    - This code is compatible with C6XXX fixed-point processors
*
* @par Benchmarks:
*  See VLIB_Test_Report.html for cycle and memory information.
