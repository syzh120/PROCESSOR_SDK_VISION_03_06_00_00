<h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>
This report summarizes results from two software quality assessment
tools used to analyze the software in this product:
<ul>
  <li>Static Program Analysis:
    <a href="http://coverity.com/products/static-analysis.html">
      Coverity Static Analysis</a>
  </li>
  <li>MISRA-C:2004 Rules:
    <a href="http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/TI_Compiler_Information">
      Texas Instruments C/C++ Compiler</a>
  </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Unless noted below, all source code, both .c and .h files, for
embedded target libraries was analyzed using these tools.
</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="CovSummary">Static Program Analysis Summary</a></h2>
<p>
This report summarizes the Static Program Analysis results. For each
library, a listing provides:
<ul>
  <li>the command-line invocation for the tool actually used for the
  analysis</li>
  <li>summary of lines-of-code (LoC) analyzed and defect types and
  counts (if any)</li>
  <li>location of defects in the source code (file name and line
  number) (if any)</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="MisraSummary">MISRA-C:2004 Summary</a></h2>
<p>
There are several rules in MISRA-C:2004 that are contrary to
long-standing coding standards used in this product, and, hence will
not be addressed in the product source code. These rules are listed in the
table below. The corresponding checks were explicitly disabled in the
tool when the source code was analyzed.

</p>

<p>Justification for Not Addressing MISRA-C:2004 Violations</p>
<ul>
  <li>In some libraries, 20.9/R (The input/output library
  &lt;stdio.h&gt; shall not be used in production code) is violated
  as the intent of the library is to provide printf-based logging
  support.</li>
  <li>The NotifyDriverMbx.c files have violations for 19.12/R and 19.10/R
  which cannot be reimplemented at this time.  These macros simplify the
  portability of the code to different cores.  The macros were reviewed again
  for correctness.
  </li>
</ul>
